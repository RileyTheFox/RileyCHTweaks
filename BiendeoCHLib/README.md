# Biendeo CH Lib
The common code for all of my mods. If you're a developer, you may also use this to make your own mods.

## How to install
- You will need Clone Hero **v0.23.2.2**.
- Make sure you install [BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) first! If you don't have a `BepInEx` folder in your CH directory, you probably haven't done this yet!
- Download the latest version of `BiendeoCHLib.zip` from [the releases page](https://github.com/RileyTheFox/RileyCHTweaks/releases) and unzip it into `~YourCHFolder\BepInEx\plugins`.

## How to uninstall
- Delete the folder `~YourCHFolder\BepInEx\plugins\Biendeo CH Lib`.

## How to use
### Default usage
There's nothing a regular user would probably get out of this mod by itself; it's mostly boilerplate for my other mods, so you probably want those as well.

# Credits
Credit to Biendeo for originally creating this library. This version is a fork with many more wrappers and the reverse patcher found in Harmony.
